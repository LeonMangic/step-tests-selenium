# exense Junit with Selenium task

This is a solution and guide on how to start Junit tests with Selenium framework

## Requirements

Install the Open-Source version of exense step application on-premise on [your machine](https://step.exense.ch/knowledgebase/3.18/getting-started/quick-setup/).

Install Chrome and the appropriate version of [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) on your machine.

## Run tests

First, change the path in UITest.java:11 the CHROME_DRIVER_PATH constant to the path to your local chrome driver.

Open the test project in IDE (I used IntelliJ IDEA), open the UITest.java, and use built-in Run Test functionalities to start the tests
